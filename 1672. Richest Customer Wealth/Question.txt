A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

 

Example 1:

Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation:
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
